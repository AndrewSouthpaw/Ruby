[ruby1.9.3-with-tk]  Starting Wed Nov 20 22:27:52 CET 2013

======================================================================

This script for Mac OS X tries to install ruby 1.9.3 with tk 8.5:
  * The installation (including homebrew) will be entirely self-contained
    and will not affect any tools you have installed already.
  * It will modify .bash_profile if you ask it to.
  * It will install in /Users/andrewsouthpaw/ruby1.9.3-with-tk and create a log in install-ruby1.9.3-with-tk.sh.log
  * Renaming or moving /Users/andrewsouthpaw/ruby1.9.3-with-tk might break ruby.
  * To uninstall, delete /Users/andrewsouthpaw/ruby1.9.3-with-tk
  * To install elsewhere, run:
      bash install-ruby1.9.3-with-tk.sh "elsewhere"

==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, so it was not symlinked into /Users/andrewsouthpaw/ruby1.9.3-with-tk/homebrew.

OS X provides the BSD libedit library, which shadows libreadline.
In order to prevent conflicts when programs look for libreadline we are
defaulting this GNU Readline installation to keg-only.

Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
build variables:

    LDFLAGS:  -L/Users/andrewsouthpaw/ruby1.9.3-with-tk/homebrew/opt/readline/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/Users/andrewsouthpaw/ruby1.9.3-with-tk/homebrew/opt/readline/include

Do you want to use this version of ruby by default?
(The command 'ruby' would run this version of ruby.)
Type 'yes' or 'no', then RETURN [default = no]:  
Edited /Users/andrewsouthpaw/.bash_profile to add ruby/irb/gem to the PATH for future shells.
Run 'source /Users/andrewsouthpaw/ruby1.9.3-with-tk/paths' to get this in the current shell.

Do you also want this version of ruby aliased as 'ruby-tk'?
(The command 'ruby-tk' would run this version of ruby.)
Type 'yes' or 'no', then RETURN [default = no]:  
Leaving aliases alone.  If you change your mind later, rerun this script.
                        It will skip straight to this step.
